Engine Code Structure


[] = array
[*] = linked list

Renderer
	window - the window of the game
	screenSurface - the surface for the window that is the dimensions of the window
	drawSurface - the surface i draw to that is fixed dimensions and that I blit to the screen surface - TODO: update screen while dragging window
	Init(SDL_Window* window, SDL_Surface* drawSurface) - creates window and drawSurface
	Update() - updates window surface
	Deinit() - frees the drawSurface
Input
	keysDown[256]
	keysJustDown[256]
	keysJustUp[256]
	mouseX
	mouseY
	mouseLBDown
	mouseLBJustDown
	mouseLBJustUp
	mouseRBDown
	mouseRBJustDown
	mouseRBJustUp
	Init() - allocates newInputs and oldInputs
	Update() - polls and pushes new input
	Deinit() - deallocates newInputs and oldInputs
Game
	renderer
	input
	curScene
	nextScene - if this isnt equal to curScene after updating and rendering, it deinits curScene, inits nextScene, and sets curScene to nextScene
	Init(Renderer renderer, Input input)
	Update()
	Render()
	Deinit()
Scene
	game
	camera - TODO: figure out the necessary details of the camera
	objects[*]
	updateFuncs[][*] - array of linked lists - the array makes it so you can ensure some things run before others
	renderFuncs[][*] - array of linked lists - the array makes it so you can ensure some things run before others
	Init(game)
	Update(input)
	Render(renderer)
	Deinit()
Object
	scene
	removeMe - if true, it will be removed after all updateFuncs in the curScene have run
	Init(scene)
	Update(input)
	Render(renderer)
	Deinit()
UpdateFuncContainer
	parentObj
	run - pointer to the function its a conainter for
	isActive
	removeMeOnNullParent - this prevents the problem of an object having 2 updateFuncs, one removing itself and the object and the other still being there
	                     - if this is true, it will be removed before running (if parentObj is null)
	removeMe - if true, it will be removed before or after running (depending if it set it itself)
	Init(parentObj, removeMeOnNullParent)
	Update(input)
	Deinit()
RenderFuncContainer
	parentObj
	run - pointer to the function its a conainter for
	isActive
	removeMeOnNullParent - this prevents the problem of an object having 2 renderFuncs, one removing itself and the object and the other still being there
	                     - if this is true, it will be removed before running (if parentObj is null)
	Init(parentObj, removeMeOnNullParent)
	Render(renderer)
	Deinit()
